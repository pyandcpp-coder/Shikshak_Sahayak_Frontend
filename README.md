# Shiksha Sahayak - Frontend

This is the frontend for Shiksha Sahayak, a powerful AI-driven learning assistant. This application allows users to input content from various sources (PDFs, websites, YouTube videos) and then engages them with an interactive chat, automated summaries, and knowledge-testing quizzes.

This project was built with a modern, responsive interface using Next.js and shadcn/ui.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pyandcpp-coder/shiksha-sahayak-frontend.git
    cd shiksha-sahayak-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add the URL of your running backend server.

    ```env
    # .env.local
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```
    *(This assumes your backend is running locally on port 8000)*

## üåê Deployment

This application is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**.

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Ensure your repository is pushed to GitHub.
2.  **Import to Vercel:** Import the project into Vercel from your GitHub repository. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js framework.
3.  **Configure Environment Variable:** In the Vercel project settings, go to "Environment Variables" and add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`. The value should be the public URL of your deployed backend (e.g., your Render service URL).

Vercel will automatically build and deploy the application upon every push to the `main` branch.
